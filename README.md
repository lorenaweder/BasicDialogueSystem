# LinearDialogueSystem
A basic NPC linear dialogue system. Define conversations and triggers and then the associated view displays the content.

Define dialogues, define triggers (can be adapted to use a OnTriggerEnter or similar, using just a key press as an example), associate a trigger with a view and implement the view to have any animation you want.
